- **statement**: an instruction that causes the program to perform some action
- **function**: a collection of statements that is executed sequentially
- **syntax**: the rules for describing how specific words can be arranged to form valid sentences
- Good comment usage: (1) describing what the file/program does (2) how the program accomplishes the goal (3) why (_not what_) the code is doing
- **data**: any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer
- **value**: a single piece of data (e.g., numbers, characters, text)
  - single-quotes are interpreted as character values. double-quotes are interpreted as text.
- **literal**: a fixed value placed directly into the source code
- **RAM** is used to load a program when running it. Additional RAM is also reserved for use while running.
- direct memory usage is discouraged in C++. access it indirectly thru objects
- **object**: a region of storage that can hold a value.
- **variable**: an object with a name (vs. unnamed/anon)
- **definition**: a special kind of declaration statement to tell the compiler we want to use a variable; e.g. `int x;`
- **allocation**: the process of reserving storage for an object's use
- **type**: what kind of value the object will store
- In C++, the type of an object must be known at compile time (so the compiler knows how much memory to allocate), and it can't be changed without re-compilation.
- `=` (assignment operator): copies the right-hand value to the left-hand variable
- **initialization**: specifying an initial value for an object
  - default-initialization (`int x;`) leaves the variable with an indeterminate value in most cases.
  - list-initialization disallow "narrowing conversions" (the conversion of a value from a larger to smaller data type)
    - `int w1 {4.5}` will cause a compilation error or warning
  - copy-initialization (`int w = 4.5`) and direct-initialization (`int w (4.5)`) will initialize the variable with value 4
  - value-initialization uses an empty set of braces (`int w {}`). this usually leads to a value of "zero" (depending on type).
  - ``[[maybe_unused]]`` (C++17): tells the compiler that we are okay with a variable being unused
- **iostream**
  - **`std::cout` is buffered**: the requested output "gets in line" in a **buffer** (region of memory that queues requests)
    - periodically, the buffer is flushed, and the data collected is transferred
  - `std::endl` actually flushes the buffer, which is already handled by C++. we can use `'\n'` for speed when dealing with text
  - `std::cin` is also buffered: the input is added to an input buffer, and the "enter" is stored as a `\n`
    - the extraction operator `>>` removes chars from the front of the input buffer and converts them to a value copy-assigned to the variable
    - if you enter input "4 5" in the example, it will assign 4 to the first var, and then stop due to the space. then it will assign 5 to the next usage of extraction
  - the basic extraction (`>>`) process
    1. if `std::cin` is in a bad state, abort the extraction process immediately (nothing else happens)
    2. leading whitespace is discarded from the buffer
    3. if the input buffer is empty, wait for the user to input something (and discard leading whitespace)
    4. extract as many characters as possible, until seeing a newline (`\n`) or invalid character for the variable being extracted to
       - if no characters can be extracted, copy-assign 0 to the variable (C++11); any future extractions fail until the `std::cin` is cleared
  - best practice: always initialize your variables, unless intentionally avoiding it for performance purposes.
  - **implementation-defined behavior**: behavior defined by a specific compiler; e.g. `sizeof(int)` may be 4 or 2.
    - avoid if possible to ensure portability
  - naming
    - **identifier**: the name of a variable or other thing. It cannot be a keyword, and it must begin with a letter or underscore, and only contain letters, underscores, and numbers.
    - best practice: camelCase and snake_case
    - code is read more often than it is written. try to save a reader's time
    - **side-effect**: an observable effect that goes beyond producing a return value; e.g. `x = 5;`.
  - **expression**: sequence of stuff that calculates a value
