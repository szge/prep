- **compiler**: a program that (1) checks your code's validity (2) translates each source code file into an **object file**.
- **linker**: a program that combines object files into a desired output file (e.g., an executable file)
  - (1) reads object files and checks validity
  - (2) resolves cross-file dependencies; throws error on failure
  - (3) links in library files
- `make` or `build2` are often used to help automate the building of complex programs
