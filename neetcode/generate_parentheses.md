Generate Parentheses
Solved
You are given an integer n. Return all well-formed parentheses strings that you can generate with n pairs of parentheses.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1

Output: ["()"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 3

Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 7


Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(4^n / sqrt(n)) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of parenthesis pairs in the string.
