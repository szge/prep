i learn to code in a way where my thought process can be inspected

day 1, spent hours figuring out how to get c++ intellisense to work on my mac but it wasn't cooperating.
at least for now I'll probably won't run my solutions here.

I learned that two pointers are potentially useful when searching for a pair of elements in an array.

solved the "trapping rain water" neetcode which was apparently a "hard". I was thinking about the solution in my head all day and it took only 5 minutes to code out the solution which was not that hard.

haven't updated log in a while but I learned about the slow and fast pointer approach for linked lists, and creating a
dummy head is often smart when dealing with deleted heads.

damn, I learned about the tortoise and hare algorithm for linked lists,
and how they can be used to detect the start of a cycle. this is used in the find duplicate number problem.
I also learned that you can delete a node from a linked list given a reference in o(1) time
without needing to search through the list. you simply copy the next into the current and delete next. holy shit

binary trees are cool, mostly intuitive

## 20240509
Different types of DFS: pre-order, in-order, post-order
apparently in-order for tree de/serialization is invalid since it doesn't uniquely identify the tree
